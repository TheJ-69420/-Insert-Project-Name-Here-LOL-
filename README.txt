OK so. I haven't thought of a name yet, but here goes.

 This project is basically just like a game where, if you type in certain shit, the "entity" you're talking to can say a multitude of things, or whatever. (cI)

It's coded in, *shocker*, Python, and you can help me out if you damn wanna.
There's also meant to be a story in this project, and mabye some LORE, but meh, the project's in it's bare-bones phase, and I can't even get
Run.bat to run for me, if you could fix that, random person who's readin' the file, or colleague who's readin' it.

Anyways, Please please please help me with project.

Thank you for reading.
